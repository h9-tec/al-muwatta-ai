# Combining Prayers in Maliki Madhab

## General Rule
The Maliki madhab does NOT permit combining prayers (jam') except during Hajj and in specific circumstances.

## When Combining is Allowed
1. **During Hajj**: At Arafat (Dhuhr with Asr) and Muzdalifah (Maghrib with Isha)
2. **While Traveling**: Some Maliki scholars allow it with conditions
3. **Rain**: Combining Maghrib and Isha in congregation due to heavy rain

## Conditions for Travel Jam'
- Distance of travel must be at least 48 miles (approximately 77 km)
- Must be actual travel, not residing in a place
- Intention to travel must be present

## Important Notes
- Combining prayers at home for convenience is NOT permitted in Maliki fiqh
- Each prayer should preferably be prayed in its time
- This is different from some other madhabs that may be more lenient

# Purification in Maliki Fiqh

## Types of Water
1. **Pure and Purifying (Tahur)**: Natural water unchanged
2. **Pure but Not Purifying**: Used water, or water mixed with pure substances
3. **Impure (Najis)**: Water mixed with impurities

## Wiping Over Socks (Masah ala al-Khuffayn)
Maliki madhab permits wiping over leather socks with conditions:
- Must be put on while in wudu
- Time limit: 1 day for resident, 3 days for traveler
- Socks must cover the ankles
- Must be durable enough for walking

## Ghusl (Full Bath)
**Obligations**:
1. Intention (niyyah)
2. Washing entire body
3. Rubbing (dalk) - unique Maliki requirement

**Recommended**:
- Starting with wudu
- Washing hair thoroughly
- Ensuring water reaches all parts

## Najasah (Impurities)
**Types**: Light (khafifa) and heavy (ghaliza)
- Dog/pig impurities require 7 washes, one with earth (Maliki view)
- Urine of baby boy: sprinkling water sufficient (kh afifa)
- Adult urine: must be washed thoroughly (ghaliza)

# Marriage Rulings in Maliki Fiqh

## Pillars of Marriage (Arkan)
1. **Wali (Guardian)**: Mandatory for virgin woman
2. **Two Witnesses**: Muslim, male, just
3. **Offer and Acceptance (Ijab wa Qabul)**
4. **Dowry (Mahr)**: Must be specified

## Conditions
- Both parties must be Muslim (or man Muslim, woman Ahl al-Kitab)
- Not within prohibited degrees of relationship
- Woman not in 'iddah (waiting period)
- No temporary marriages (mut'ah) - prohibited

## Wali (Guardian) Rules
- For virgin: Wali is mandatory (father or next male relative)
- For previously married woman: Maliki scholars differ
- Wali cannot be forced to give daughter in marriage

## Mahr (Dowry)
- Minimum: No specific minimum in Maliki view (should be reasonable)
- Given to the wife, not her family
- Can be paid immediately or deferred

## Unique Maliki Positions
- A woman can stipulate conditions in marriage contract
- Marriage without wali is invalid (batil)
- Public announcement of marriage is recommended
