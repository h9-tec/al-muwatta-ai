# Tayammum in Maliki Fiqh

## When Tayammum is Permitted
1. Absence of water (within reasonable distance)
2. Inability to use water (sickness, extreme cold)
3. Fear of harm from using water
4. Water needed for drinking/cooking

## How to Perform Tayammum
1. **Intention (niyyah)** - for purification
2. **Strike clean earth once** with both hands
3. **Wipe the face** completely
4. **Wipe both hands** to the wrists

## Maliki Specific Rulings
- ONE strike is sufficient (not two as in other madhabs)
- Wiping to wrists (not elbows)
- Can use any clean earth, sand, or dust
- Cannot use stone, metal, or wood alone
- Must search for water if unsure of its availability

## What Invalidates Tayammum
- Finding water (must perform wudu)
- Anything that breaks wudu also breaks tayammum
- Water becomes available
